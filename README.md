# The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors
This project is divided into two parts:
- Part 1: JavaScript for win/loss/draw computation
- Part 2: Building a UI for the JavaScript
<!--end list -->

## Part 1
In this part, I only wrote the JS that allows the user to play the game via a generic prompt.
<br><br>
The key takeaways from this were:<br>
- The problem solving process
- Using JS functions
<!--end list -->

## Part 2
In this part, I created a UI to allow the user to play rock-paper-scissors on demand.
<br><br>
The key takeaways from this were:<br>
- Using query selectors and event listeners
- Dynamically changing the DOM based on JavaScript logic/actions
<!--end list -->
<br><br>
Some other cool things I learned along the way:<br>
- Using the audio HTML tag and its attributes
