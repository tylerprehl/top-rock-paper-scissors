# The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors
This project is divided into two parts:
<ul>
    <li>Part 1: JavaScript for win/loss/draw computation</li>
    <li>Part 2: Building a UI for the JavaScript</li>
</ul>

## Part 1
In this part, I only wrote the JS that allows the user to play the game via a generic prompt.
<br><br>
The key takeaways from this were:<br>
<ul>
    <li>The problem solving process</li>
    <li>Using JS functions</li>
</ul>

## Part 2
In this part, I created a UI to allow the user to play rock-paper-scissors on demand.
<br><br>
The key takeaways from this were:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Using query selectors and event listeners</li>
    <li>Dynamically changing the DOM based on JavaScript logic/actions</li>
</ul>
<br>

Some other cool things I learned along the way:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Using the audio HTML tag and its attributes</li>
    <li>Using emojis in HTML</li>
</ul>
